# TaskRadius
App for planning my everyday routine and helping to prevent me from forgetting items at home

1. Auto-Generated Daily Checklist

    Backend Logic:
        Store common tasks in a database.
        Use a cron job or similar scheduling service to generate a new checklist daily.
    Frontend Display:
        Display the checklist in a user-friendly format.
        Allow users to check off items as they complete them.
    Tech Stack Suggestions: Node.js/Express for backend, React or Vue.js for frontend.

2. Location-Based Notifications

    GPS and Geofencing:
        Utilize the GPS capabilities of the user's device.
        Implement geofencing to determine when the user leaves a specific area (e.g., home).
    Notification Service:
        If tasks are unchecked and the user leaves the predefined area, trigger a notification.
    APIs: Google Maps API or similar for geolocation services.
    Permissions: Ensure the app requests and handles location permissions properly.

3. Routine Planner

    Separate Page/Tab:
        Create a distinct section for the routine planner.
        Allow users to add, edit, and view daily routines.
    User Interaction: Drag-and-drop interface for organizing tasks might be user-friendly.

4. Sleek Design Using HTML and CSS

    Layout: Use a responsive design framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for a modern look.
    Aesthetics: Choose a color scheme and fonts that are visually appealing and accessible.
    Interactivity: Use CSS animations and transitions for smoother user interactions.

5. Technical Considerations

    Responsive Design: Ensure the app is usable on both mobile and desktop devices.
    State Management: For a single-page application, consider using Redux or Context API for state management.
    Database: A NoSQL database like MongoDB or a SQL database like PostgreSQL can be used to store user data and checklists.

6. Development Process

    Prototype: Start by creating wireframes or prototypes of your app using tools like Figma or Sketch.
    Development: Break down the development into phases, starting with basic functionality and then adding features.
    Testing: Regularly test the app for bugs, user experience, and performance issues.
